This is a prototype for defining a scripting language.

Example script:
tell application "eventheap"
	set event heap name to "127.0.0.1"
	set event type name to "my type name"
end tell

======================================================
Notes on compilation:
Beware that in order to change the language, 

====================================================	
Improvement:

-language improvement:
	tell application "eventheap"
		set name to "parker"	
	end tell

-language improvement: send command
	tell application "eventheap"
		set name to "parker"
		send myEvent
	end tell

-language improvement define event object
	tell application "eventheap"
		set myEvent to make new event type "asdad"?	
	end tell

-language improvement: set fields
	tell application "eventheap"
		set myEvent to .....	
		set fields of myEvent to {("ADS","ASDD"),("asdd","ASD")}
	end tell
