__How to start iStuff__

In general the iStuff.jar file needs to be executed - we provide some start
scripts:

	* Linux/Mac User:
		Run './start' from this directory
		or use 'sh start.sh' to start.

	* Mac User only:
		Use the iStuff.app inside this directory
		to start, make sure that the .jar file is
		in the same directory as the .app application.

	* Windows User:
		Execute the startWin.bat from this
		directory.

	* All Users:
		In most cases you are able to just doubleclick
		the iStuff.jar file.

Hint for Mac users: Just put the whole iStuff folder into your Application
folder and start by using the iStuff.app

Make sure, that your JVM is Java5.0 (aka java 1.5.0) compliant and have the
bin dirctory of your java in your PATH variable.

__Installing the Quarz Composer plugins__

	* Mac User only:
		Execute the file 'QC iStuff Installer.pmproj' by
		double clicking it. Follow the instructions to
		install the plugins.
